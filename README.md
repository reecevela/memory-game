# memory-game

Built with React, and in the process I learned a lot about state and hooks for functional components and how to implement them with useEffect();

This was also my first time configuring and using SASS with React, and I've got to admit that it's pretty awesome!

Refreshing the page also gives you a random choice of ten different sets of cards, from Cities to Emojis to Fantasy Monsters etc.
